    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>
      Perhaps you have wondered how predictable machines like computers can
      generate randomness. In reality, most random numbers used in computer
      programs are pseudo-random, which means they are generated in a
      predictable fashion using a mathematical formula. This is fine for many
      purposes, but it may not be random in the way you expect if you're used to
      dice rolls and lottery drawings. RANDOM.ORG offers true random numbers to
      anyone on the Internet. The randomness comes from atmospheric noise, which
      for many purposes is better than the pseudo-random number algorithms
      typically used in computer programs. People use RANDOM.ORG for holding
      drawings, lotteries and sweepstakes, to drive online games, for scientific
      applications and for art and music. The service has existed since 1998 and
      was built by Dr Mads Haahr of the School of Computer Science and
      Statistics at Trinity College, Dublin in Ireland. Today, RANDOM.ORG is
      operated by Randomness and Integrity Services Ltd.
